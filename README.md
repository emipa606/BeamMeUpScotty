- **Teleport workstation**: at least one is needed. It will give orders to tp spots.
- **Mini station**: smaller workstation, with smaller capacities.
- **Teleport spot**: build it close to the workstation and choose the way it works. It is also a storage, meaning you can prioritize what pawns will put on it. You can choose to automate teleportation and the way it goes : in, out, swap.
- **Teleport catcher**: cheap wooden building that you can link to a teleport spot. It is a storage. A pawn or any object standing on it will be teleported.
- **Teleport bed**: cheap building that allows to teleport wounded, incapacitated or captured pawns.
- **Teleport box**: did you think we would leave the cat behind?
